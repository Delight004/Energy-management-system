This research utilized two primary datasets to support the development of the forecasting models:

PV Output Data:
Solar energy generation data was obtained from the Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS). This dataset includes hourly records of global 
solar irradiance, air temperature, wind speed, and sun height, tailored to a specific geographical location (latitude 52.865°N, longitude -7.979°W). 
It was used to train machine learning models for PV output forecasting.

Load Consumption Data:
Residential energy consumption data was sourced from an energy community in Ireland, covering the year 2020. This high-resolution dataset includes per-minute 
readings of electricity usage, PV generation, battery charging/discharging, grid import/export, and state of charge. It was aggregated and preprocessed to 
support accurate load forecasting.

Together, these datasets enabled robust training and evaluation of the forecasting models, ensuring realistic simulation of the EMS under real-world operating conditions.
